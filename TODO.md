# ToDo

* do timelapse thumbs or whatever
* client side waiting/error modals
* add a Pins table to avoid duplicate pinned images
* add an aspect ratio column to cameras; plumb into Bulma <figure> aspect
* clean way to load repo config overloads from DB
* figure out what to do for timelapse thumbnail/card

# Done

* make Repository robust against missing camera directories (i.e. don't 500 in /client/state for this)
* pixel pushing on gallery and lightbox
